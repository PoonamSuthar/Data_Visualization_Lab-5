Identify relationship among different variables by PairGrid and pairplot.
From the resulting plot of Scatterplot, pairplot matrix and Evaluate the classifier's performance , it appears that the setosa species is linearly separable from the other two species,while versicolor and virginica are not easily separated.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Exploratory data analysis involves examining and summarizing a dataset to better understand its underlying patterns, relationships, and characteristics.
Some explanatory graphics that could be used to present EDA findings include: Bar chart or pie chart to show the distribution of income levels (e.g., <=50K, >50K) in the dataset.
Histogram to show the distribution of age in the dataset, Boxplot or violin plot to compare the distributions of age by income level, Scatterplot or heatmap to show the relationship between age and education level, Stacked bar chart to show the proportion of income levels by gender etc.
